\# üöÄ Tank Filling Automation using TIA Portal V17 + S7-1200



This project simulates an automated tank filling operation using Siemens TIA Portal V17 and PLCSIM Advanced. The logic is implemented using SCL (Structured Control Language), and device emulation is performed via PLCSIM.

\## üìò System Description



The system automates the filling of a tank using digital inputs and outputs. It includes:



\- A \*\*valve\*\* that controls the flow of liquid into the tank.

\- A \*\*switch\*\* to turn the system on/off.

\- A \*\*fill button\*\* to initiate the filling process.

\- A \*\*lamp test button\*\* to verify all indicator lamps.

\- \*\*Four level sensors\*\* to detect the tank's fill level.

\- \*\*Indicator lamps\*\* to show the current level of the tank.

\## üß† Working Principle



\- When the system is switched on and the fill button is pressed, the valve opens to start filling the tank.

\- As the tank fills, level sensors activate corresponding lamps to indicate the current level.

\- The lamp test button can be used to light up all lamps for verification, regardless of sensor status.

\- PLCSIM Advanced is used to emulate sensor inputs and monitor tag values in real-time.
